                        <p>Season #5 of Pixel Craft this season we have done some major changes such as using Fabric on the servers backend running the Lithium mod, the Carpet mod, and a few other server side things that are handy. We still have datapack from Vanilla Tweaks and CurseForge, with our own custom datapack thrown in there as well. Shops are getting a bit of a downgrade as were using redstone & the honor system for them this season plus we have a few suprises if you are playing on the server this season.</p>
                        <p>We have two optional things for people to use if the want and one required thing. The optional things are a Forge & Fabric clients. The required thing is a Custom Resource Pack that we use for the custom things that we wanted to add to the server. You can get all of these from <a class="downloads" href="https://download.pixilaremedia.com/#PM-Pixel-Craft-Season-5-Additional" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
