      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>Season #1 of Pixel Modded this was a fun little adventure using the <a class="external-links" href="https://atlauncher.com/pack/themadpack" target="_blank">Mad Pack 3</a> modpack. The two people who mainly played on there eventually decided to close it down as they were nolonger having fun. Unfortunatly there is no world download for this season as it was lost when they were switching computers.</p>
